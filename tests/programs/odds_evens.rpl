@ Odds vs Evens Ratio Test
@
@ For X, Y ~ Uniform(0,1), compute round(X/Y) and check if odd or even.
@
@ The ratio R = X/Y has PDF: f(r) = 1/2 for r in (0,1], f(r) = 1/(2r²) for r > 1
@
@ P(round = 0) = P(R < 0.5) = 1/4
@ P(round = n) = 2/((2n-1)(2n+1)) for n >= 1
@
@ P(even) = 1/4 + sum over n=1,2,3... of 2/((4n-1)(4n+1))
@         = 1/4 + (1/3 - 1/5) + (1/7 - 1/9) + (1/11 - 1/13) + ...
@         ≈ 0.4647
